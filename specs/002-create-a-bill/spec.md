# Feature Specification: Create Bill Table and Migration

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-a-bill`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a bill table and the corresponding migration. The fields in the bill table are as follows, to be applied in the current backend: id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- (1) No., auto-increment, primary key form_no TEXT, -- (2) Form number serial_no TEXT, -- (3) Serial symbol invoice_no TEXT, -- (4) Invoice number issued_date DATE, -- (5) Date of issue seller_name TEXT, -- (6) Seller's name seller_tax_code TEXT, -- (7) Seller's tax code item_name TEXT, -- (8) Goods/Service name unit TEXT, -- (9) Unit quantity NUMERIC(18, 2), -- (10) Quantity unit_price NUMERIC(18, 2), -- (11) Unit price total_amount NUMERIC(18, 2), -- (12) Value of goods/services purchased, excluding VAT vat_rate NUMERIC(5, 2), -- (13) VAT rate (%) vat_amount NUMERIC(18, 2) -- (14) VAT amount Note: This specification does not require creating any API, and TDD is omitted for this spec"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature description provided: Create bill table with specified fields
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: System/Database
   ’ Actions: Create table, run migration
   ’ Data: Bill records with 14 fields for invoice management
   ’ Constraints: No API required, TDD omitted
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All requirements are clearly specified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Database operations for bill storage
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable through database queries
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Bill entity with comprehensive invoice fields
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No implementation details specified (database-agnostic)
   ’ Focus on data structure requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I need a bill table to store comprehensive invoice information including seller details, item information, pricing, and VAT calculations so that the OCR system can persist processed bill data for further analysis and reporting.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the database system is running, **When** the migration is executed, **Then** a new bill table is created with all specified fields
2. **Given** the bill table exists, **When** bill data is inserted, **Then** all field types and constraints are properly enforced
3. **Given** the bill table has data, **When** queries are executed, **Then** all fields return correct data types and precision

### Edge Cases
- What happens when numeric fields exceed specified precision (18,2)?
- How does the system handle NULL values in optional text fields?
- What happens if date fields receive invalid date formats?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create a bill table with an auto-incrementing primary key field (id)
- **FR-002**: System MUST store form number, serial symbol, and invoice number as text fields
- **FR-003**: System MUST record issue date with proper date validation
- **FR-004**: System MUST capture seller information including name and tax code
- **FR-005**: System MUST store item details including name and unit of measurement
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle numeric calculations with proper precision for quantity, pricing, and VAT
- **FR-007**: System MUST support VAT rate storage with 2 decimal places (percentage)
- **FR-008**: System MUST calculate and store VAT amount and total amounts with 2 decimal precision
- **FR-009**: Migration MUST be reversible for deployment safety
- **FR-010**: Table structure MUST support the OCR bill processing workflow

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Bill**: Represents a complete invoice/bill record containing seller information, item details, pricing calculations, and tax information. Core entity for the OCR bill processing system with 14 distinct fields covering all aspects of Vietnamese invoice requirements.
