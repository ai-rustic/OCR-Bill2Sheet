# Feature Specification: Bill Service APIs

**Feature Branch**: `003-bill-service-apis`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Bill Service APIs: GET /bills Retrieve all bills. GET /bills/{id} Retrieve a specific bill by ID. POST /bills Create a new bill (request body: full bill data). PUT /bills/{id} Update a bill by ID (request body: fields to update). DELETE /bills/{id} Delete a bill by ID. GET /bills/search?invoice={pattern} Search bills by invoice number (partial match). GET /bills/count Get the total count of bills. Requirements: Each API should use proper HTTP status codes. Return consistent JSON response structure (success, data, error)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ User requests REST API endpoints for bill management operations
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: API consumers (likely frontend/external systems)
   ’ Actions: CRUD operations on bills, search, count
   ’ Data: Vietnamese invoice/bill data with existing 14-field structure
   ’ Constraints: HTTP standards, consistent JSON responses
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Authentication/authorization requirements not specified]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Pagination requirements for listing endpoints not specified]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Rate limiting or API quotas not specified]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear API operation flows for bill management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each API endpoint with expected behavior
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Bill entity already exists with 14 fields
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding auth and pagination"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an API consumer (frontend application or external system), I need to manage Vietnamese invoice/bill data through RESTful endpoints so that I can create, read, update, delete, search, and count bills in the system to support invoice processing workflows.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the API is accessible, **When** I request all bills, **Then** I receive a list of all bills with consistent JSON structure
2. **Given** a specific bill ID exists, **When** I request that bill, **Then** I receive the complete bill data
3. **Given** valid bill data, **When** I create a new bill, **Then** the system creates the bill and returns the created record with generated ID
4. **Given** an existing bill ID and updated data, **When** I update the bill, **Then** the system updates the record and returns the modified bill
5. **Given** an existing bill ID, **When** I delete the bill, **Then** the system removes the bill and confirms deletion
6. **Given** an invoice number pattern, **When** I search for bills, **Then** I receive all bills with matching invoice numbers
7. **Given** bills exist in the system, **When** I request the count, **Then** I receive the total number of bills

### Edge Cases
- What happens when requesting a non-existent bill ID?
- How does the system handle invalid bill data during creation?
- What occurs when searching with empty or invalid patterns?
- How are empty result sets returned consistently?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide endpoint to retrieve all bills with complete bill data
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide endpoint to retrieve a specific bill by unique identifier
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide endpoint to create new bills accepting full Vietnamese invoice data structure
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide endpoint to update existing bills by identifier
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide endpoint to delete bills by identifier
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide endpoint to search bills by invoice number using partial matching
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide endpoint to return total count of bills in system
- **FR-008**: System MUST return consistent JSON response structure with success, data, and error fields
- **FR-009**: System MUST return appropriate HTTP status codes for each operation (200, 201, 404, 400, 500, etc.)
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle Vietnamese text encoding properly in all bill fields
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate financial data precision for amounts and rates
- **FR-012**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Authentication/authorization requirements not specified - should endpoints be public or require authentication?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Pagination requirements not specified - should listing endpoints support pagination for large datasets?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Bill**: Vietnamese invoice record with 14 fields including form number, serial number, invoice number, issued date, seller information (name, tax code), item details (name, unit, quantity, unit price), and financial calculations (total amount, VAT rate, VAT amount)
