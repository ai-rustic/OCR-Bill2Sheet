# Feature Specification: OCR Image Upload API Endpoint

**Feature Branch**: `004-add-post-api`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add POST /api/ocr API endpoint to accept image uploads. The API should: - Allow receiving multiple images per request. - The maximum number of images allowed per request, and maximum image file size, must be configurable via environment variables. - Do not implement storage or persistence for uploaded images yet; only handle receiving the files. - Properly handle multipart/form-data requests for image upload. - Validate and reject images exceeding the defined file size and count limits. - Note: Due to technical restrictions with the Axum Rust framework, each image can be at most 2MB in size. The task is only to build the request receiving endpoint and validation logic, not full storage or additional processing."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A client application needs to submit one or more invoice/bill images to the OCR system for text extraction processing. The client sends images through a web API, receives immediate validation feedback, and gets confirmation that the images were accepted for future processing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a client has 1-3 valid image files (JPG/PNG, each under 2MB), **When** they submit via POST /api/ocr with multipart/form-data, **Then** the system accepts the request and returns success confirmation
2. **Given** a client submits 5 images when the system limit is 3, **When** the request is processed, **Then** the system rejects the request with a clear error message about exceeding image count limit
3. **Given** a client submits one image file that is 3MB in size, **When** the request is processed, **Then** the system rejects the request with a clear error message about exceeding file size limit
4. **Given** system environment variables are configured with MAX_IMAGES=5 and MAX_FILE_SIZE=1MB, **When** a client submits 4 images of 800KB each, **Then** the system accepts the request
5. **Given** a client sends a request with non-image files, **When** the request is processed, **Then** the system rejects the request with appropriate error message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when environment variables for limits are not set or invalid?
- How does system handle corrupted image files that pass initial validation?
- What happens when the request contains mixed content types (images + other files)?
- How does system respond to requests with no files attached?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*


### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Image Upload Request**: Contains multiple image files, metadata about file count and sizes
- **Validation Result**: Contains success/failure status, error messages, accepted file information
- **Configuration Settings**: Maximum file size limit, maximum image count limit sourced from environment
