# Feature Specification: Modify /api/ocr endpoint to response in SSE (Server-Sent Events)

**Feature Branch**: `005-modify-api-ocr`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Modify /api/ocr endpoint to response in SSE (Server-Sent Events)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Identify need to change response format from JSON to Server-Sent Events
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: API clients, OCR processing system
   � Actions: Image upload, real-time status updates, streaming responses
   � Data: Image files, processing status, validation results
   � Constraints: Maintain existing validation logic, preserve multipart upload
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific events should be streamed during OCR processing?]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the expected frequency of status updates during processing?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User uploads images and receives real-time processing updates
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement focused on streaming capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   � OCR processing events, status updates, validation events
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties about specific event types and compatibility"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A client application uploads multiple images to the OCR endpoint and receives real-time updates about the processing status through a persistent Server-Sent Events connection. The client can monitor validation progress, processing stages, and receive final results without polling or waiting for a single large response.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a client has 3 valid image files, **When** they submit via POST /api/ocr, **Then** the system immediately responds with an SSE stream providing real-time validation and processing updates
2. **Given** an image fails validation during upload, **When** the validation error occurs, **Then** the system sends an error event through the SSE stream with specific details about the failure
3. **Given** all images are successfully validated, **When** processing completes, **Then** the system sends a final completion event with all validated image information before closing the stream

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the client disconnects during processing?  processing will be cancelled?
- How does system handle network interruptions in the SSE stream? No retry mechanism needed - client must reconnect
- What happens if image validation takes longer than expected? Cancel processing and send processing_error event

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept the same multipart/form-data image uploads as the current endpoint
- **FR-002**: System MUST respond with Server-Sent Events format as the default and only response format
- **FR-003**: System MUST stream real-time events during image validation process
- **FR-004**: System MUST send validation status events for each uploaded image as it's processed
- **FR-005**: System MUST send a completion event with final results when all images are processed
- **FR-006**: System MUST send error events immediately when validation failures occur
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain the existing file size and count validation limits
- **FR-008**: System MUST completely replace JSON response format with SSE - no backward compatibility required
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle client disconnections gracefully during processing
- **FR-010**: Events MUST include the following types: upload_started, image_received, image_validation_start, image_validation_success, image_validation_error, all_images_validated, processing_complete, processing_error
- **FR-011**: System MUST cancel processing and send processing_error event if validation takes longer than expected timeout
- **FR-012**: System MUST not implement retry mechanism for network interruptions - clients must reconnect manually

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Processing Event**: Represents a single status update during OCR processing, contains event type, timestamp, and relevant data
- **Validation Event**: Specific type of processing event that indicates image validation status, includes file information and validation results
- **Error Event**: Event type for communicating validation or processing failures, includes error details and affected file information
- **Completion Event**: Final event indicating all processing is complete, contains summary of all processed images
