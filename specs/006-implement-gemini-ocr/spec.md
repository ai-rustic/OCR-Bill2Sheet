# Feature Specification: Gemini OCR Integration

**Feature Branch**: `006-implement-gemini-ocr`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement Gemini OCR
Please help me add to the image processing flow at api/ocr: for each uploaded image, use the Gemini API to extract bill information from the image. The extracted information must be structured output based on the fields of the bills table in the database. Images are processed sequentially, sending each image one by one to Gemini. The Gemini API key and Gemini model to use are configured in the .env file."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature involves integrating Gemini AI for OCR bill processing
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: users uploading images, Gemini API
   ’ Actions: image upload, OCR extraction, structured data output
   ’ Data: bill images, extracted bill information, database fields
   ’ Constraints: sequential processing, environment configuration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Error handling when Gemini API fails]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum image size/format limits]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Processing timeout limits]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User uploads bill image ’ system extracts structured data
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement covers OCR integration aspects
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Bill images, extracted bill data, API responses
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Spec has uncertainties marked for clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user uploads one or more bill images through the OCR API endpoint. The system processes each image sequentially through Gemini AI to extract structured bill information that matches the database schema fields. The extracted data is returned to the user in a format that can be used to populate bill records.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a clear bill image, **When** they upload it to the OCR endpoint, **Then** the system returns structured bill data with all identifiable fields populated
2. **Given** a user uploads multiple bill images, **When** the system processes them, **Then** each image is processed sequentially and results are returned in the same order
3. **Given** a bill image contains Vietnamese text, **When** processed by Gemini, **Then** the system correctly extracts Vietnamese characters and currency formatting
4. **Given** a bill image has poor quality or unclear text, **When** processed, **Then** the system returns partial data with confidence indicators for each field

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Gemini API is unavailable or returns errors? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Fallback behavior not specified]
- How does system handle images that are not bills (e.g., random photos)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Non-bill image handling not specified]
- What happens when image exceeds size limits? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Image size/format limits not specified]
- How long should the system wait for Gemini response before timing out? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Timeout limits not specified]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST process uploaded images sequentially through Gemini API for OCR extraction
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract bill information that maps to all fields in the bills database table schema
- **FR-003**: System MUST return structured data output that matches the bill entity format
- **FR-004**: System MUST read Gemini API configuration from environment variables
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle multiple images in a single request by processing them one at a time
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve Vietnamese text encoding in extracted bill data
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate extracted data against expected bill field types and formats
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle API failures gracefully [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific error handling behavior not defined]
- **FR-009**: System MUST respect image format and size constraints [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific limits not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST complete processing within reasonable time limits [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance requirements not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Bill Image**: Uploaded image files containing Vietnamese invoice/bill information, supports common formats
- **Extracted Bill Data**: Structured data output from Gemini OCR containing fields that map to the bills table schema (form_no, invoice_no, tax_code, etc.)
- **OCR Response**: Result from Gemini API processing including extracted text, confidence scores, and field mappings
