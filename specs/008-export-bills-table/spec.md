# Feature Specification: Export Bills Table

**Feature Branch**: `008-export-bills-table`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "export bills table
Th�m cho t�i api/bills/export?format=xxx query param nh�n csv ho�c xlsx � c� th� xu�t b�ng bills trong database ra th�nh file csv ho�c file .xlsx v� tr� v� file � cho ng��i d�ng"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Request for bills data export functionality with format selection
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: Users needing bill data exports
   � Actions: Export bills table data to files
   � Data: All bills in database
   � Constraints: CSV and XLSX format support
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Export all 14 bill fields with column headers
   � Export complete dataset without pagination limits
   � No filtering options required
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User requests export, selects format, downloads file
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Export endpoint with format parameter
   � CSV and XLSX file generation
   � File download delivery
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Bills data from existing table
7. Run Review Checklist
   � All clarifications resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user needs to analyze bill data outside the application by exporting all bills from the database into a spreadsheet or CSV file for further processing, reporting, or backup purposes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system contains bill records, **When** user requests export in CSV format, **Then** system generates and delivers a CSV file with all bill data
2. **Given** the system contains bill records, **When** user requests export in XLSX format, **Then** system generates and delivers an Excel file with all bill data
3. **Given** the database is empty, **When** user requests export, **Then** system delivers an empty file with proper headers
4. **Given** invalid format parameter is provided, **When** user requests export, **Then** system returns an error message with supported formats

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the dataset is very large (thousands of bills)?
- How does the system handle concurrent export requests?
- What happens if file generation fails during processing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an export endpoint that accepts format parameter
- **FR-002**: System MUST support CSV format export of bills data
- **FR-003**: System MUST support XLSX format export of bills data
- **FR-004**: System MUST include all 14 bill fields with appropriate column headers in the exported data
- **FR-005**: System MUST return the generated file for download
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate the format parameter and reject unsupported formats
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle empty datasets gracefully by providing files with headers only
- **FR-008**: System MUST set appropriate file headers for download (Content-Type, Content-Disposition)
- **FR-009**: CSV files MUST use UTF-8 with BOM encoding and XLSX files MUST use UTF-8 encoding to preserve Vietnamese text properly
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow unrestricted access to export functionality without authentication or access controls

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Bill**: Existing entity with 14 fields including form_no, invoice_no, dates, amounts, and Vietnamese text fields that will be exported to external files
