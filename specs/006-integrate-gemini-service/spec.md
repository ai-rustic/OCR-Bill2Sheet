# Feature Specification: Integrate Gemini Service to API/OCR

**Feature Branch**: `006-integrate-gemini-service`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Integrate gemini service to api/ocr - � api/ocr, v�i list �nh ng��i d�ng g�i l�n => S� g�i �nh � sang api gemini v�i y�u c�u tr�ch xu�t n�i dung bill t� trong �nh - X� l� tu�n t� t�ng �nh, v�i m�i �nh ��c x� l� xong => Response l�i cho ng��i d�ng th�ng qua SSE => L�n l��t cho �n h�t - Request g�i sang cho gemini service s� c� y�u c�u stuctured output => Y�u c�u c�c tr��ng tr� v� d�a theo c�c c�t c�a b�ng bills ang li�n k�t v�i backend trong database"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature involves OCR integration with Gemini AI service
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: Users uploading images, Gemini AI service
   � Actions: Upload images, extract bill data, stream responses
   � Data: Bill images, structured bill data, database fields
   � Constraints: Sequential processing, SSE streaming
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: API authentication method for Gemini service]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Error handling when Gemini service fails]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Image format and size limitations]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flow: upload � process � receive streamed results
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Bill images, extracted bill data, processing status
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding API configuration"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user uploads multiple bill images to the OCR API endpoint and receives real-time extraction results as each image is processed. The system sequentially processes each image through Gemini AI service to extract structured bill data matching the database schema, streaming results back to the user via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has 3 bill images to upload, **When** they submit the images to the OCR API, **Then** they receive an SSE stream with processing status updates and extracted data for each image in sequence
2. **Given** an image contains a Vietnamese invoice, **When** the system processes it through Gemini service, **Then** the extracted data includes all relevant fields matching the bills database schema
3. **Given** one image in a batch fails to process, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the system continues processing remaining images and reports the error via SSE
4. **Given** the Gemini service is temporarily unavailable, **When** images are submitted for processing, **Then** users receive appropriate error messages via SSE stream

### Edge Cases
- What happens when uploaded images are corrupted or unreadable?
- How does system handle when Gemini service returns incomplete or invalid structured data?
- What occurs if the SSE connection is interrupted during processing?
- How are very large images or batch uploads managed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept multiple bill images in a single OCR API request
- **FR-002**: System MUST process uploaded images sequentially, one at a time
- **FR-003**: System MUST send each uploaded image to Gemini AI service for content extraction
- **FR-004**: System MUST request structured output from Gemini service matching the bills database schema fields
- **FR-005**: System MUST stream processing results to users via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide real-time status updates for each image being processed
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle Vietnamese text content in bill images
- **FR-008**: System MUST continue processing remaining images if one image fails
- **FR-009**: System MUST authenticate with Gemini service using GEMINI_API_KEY stored in environment variables
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate extracted data structure before streaming to user
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle rate limiting from Gemini service by closing SSE connection and notifying users to retry later
- **FR-012**: System MUST support JPG, PNG, and JFIF image formats
- **FR-013**: System MUST use existing MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES configuration from environment for image size validation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Bill Image**: Uploaded image files containing Vietnamese invoice/bill data, with metadata like filename, size, format
- **Extracted Bill Data**: Structured data extracted from images, conforming to bills database schema with fields for invoice numbers, amounts, dates, vendor information
- **Processing Status**: Real-time status of each image in the batch, including states like pending, processing, completed, failed
- **SSE Stream**: Server-sent event stream providing real-time updates to users about processing progress and results
