# Feature Specification: Backend Database Connection

## Overview
Connect the backend application to the bill_ocr PostgreSQL database to enable data persistence and retrieval for the OCR Bill2Sheet application.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR1**: Backend must establish connection to PostgreSQL database named "bill_ocr"
- **FR2**: Connection must use SQLx with compile-time query validation
- **FR3**: Connection pooling must be implemented for performance
- **FR4**: Database configuration must be environment-driven
- **FR5**: Support async database operations using Axum framework

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1**: Connection must be established at application startup
- **NFR2**: Failed database connections must prevent application startup
- **NFR3**: Connection pool must handle concurrent requests efficiently
- **NFR4**: Database credentials must be securely managed via environment variables

### Constraints
- Use existing database schema (no table creation or model modifications)
- Follow Axum + SQLx architecture as per constitution
- Use environment configuration for database URL
- No ORM usage - direct SQLx queries only

## User Stories

### US1: Database Connection Initialization
**As a** backend developer
**I want** the application to connect to the bill_ocr database on startup
**So that** all database operations are available for the application lifecycle

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application connects to PostgreSQL database "bill_ocr" on startup
- Connection failure causes graceful application shutdown with error message
- Connection pool is configured with appropriate limits

### US2: Environment Configuration
**As a** deployment engineer
**I want** database connection details to be configurable via environment variables
**So that** different environments (dev, staging, prod) can use different database instances

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- DATABASE_URL environment variable configures connection
- Default fallback for development environment
- Secure handling of database credentials

## Technical Context
- Backend framework: Axum (Rust)
- Database: PostgreSQL (existing bill_ocr database)
- ORM/Query layer: SQLx with compile-time validation
- Configuration: Environment-based
- Connection management: Connection pooling required

## Success Criteria
1. Backend successfully connects to bill_ocr database
2. Connection pool is properly configured
3. Environment variables control database configuration
4. Application startup fails gracefully if database is unavailable
5. Ready for future database query implementation
