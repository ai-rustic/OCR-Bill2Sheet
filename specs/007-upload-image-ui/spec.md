   ’ Feature description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: users, Actions: upload/preview/delete images, Data: image files, Constraints: UI only, specific formats
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All aspects clearly specified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Image entity identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No implementation details, UI-focused
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to upload multiple images to the system so that I can process them for OCR. I need to see previews of my uploaded images, track upload progress, and remove images I don't want to process. I should be able to either drag and drop files or click to select them from my computer.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the upload page, **When** I drag and drop image files onto the upload area, **Then** the files should be accepted and show upload progress
2. **Given** I am on the upload page, **When** I click the file selection button, **Then** a file dialog should open allowing me to select multiple image files
3. **Given** I have selected image files, **When** the upload begins, **Then** I should see individual progress bars for each image
4. **Given** images are uploading, **When** an upload completes, **Then** I should see a preview thumbnail of the uploaded image
5. **Given** I have uploaded images with previews, **When** I click the delete button on an image, **Then** that image should be removed from the upload list
6. **Given** I try to upload a non-image file, **When** the file is processed, **Then** the system should reject it and show an error message
7. **Given** I upload multiple images, **When** all uploads are complete, **Then** I should see all image previews organized in a grid layout

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I try to upload unsupported file formats (not jpg, png, jfif)?
- How does the system handle very large image files?
- What happens if I try to upload the same image multiple times?
- How does the system behave when I drag files while other uploads are in progress?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a drag-and-drop upload area for image files
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a click-to-select file upload option as alternative to drag-and-drop
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow unlimited number of image uploads in a single session
- **FR-004**: System MUST display individual upload progress for each image file
- **FR-005**: System MUST show preview thumbnails of successfully uploaded images
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to delete individual images from the upload collection
- **FR-007**: System MUST restrict file uploads to jpg, png, and jfif formats only
- **FR-008**: System MUST reject non-image files with clear error messaging
- **FR-009**: System MUST organize uploaded image previews in a responsive grid layout
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide visual feedback during drag-and-drop operations (hover states)
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain upload state without requiring backend API integration
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle multiple simultaneous file uploads

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Image File**: Represents an uploaded image with properties including file name, file size, upload status, preview data, and file format validation status
