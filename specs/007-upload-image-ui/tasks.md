# Tasks: Upload Image UI

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-upload-image-ui/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅
**Context**: Skip TDD, Skip test cases, Manual testing only

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ Implementation plan loaded - Frontend TypeScript/React with Shadcn UI
2. Load optional design documents:
   → ✅ data-model.md: UploadedImage entity, state management
   → ✅ contracts/: Component interfaces for UI
   → ✅ research.md: Shadcn UI components, file handling decisions
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: frontend structure, dependencies
   → Core: utility functions, custom hooks, UI components
   → Integration: component composition, event handling
   → Polish: manual testing, refinements
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different components = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Skip tests per user preference
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All components from contracts have tasks
   → All utilities from data model have tasks
   → All user interactions covered
9. Return: ✅ SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app structure**: `frontend/src/` for all components
- Paths follow Next.js 14+ conventions with TypeScript

## Phase 3.1: Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] T001 Create frontend project structure in frontend/src/components/upload/
- [x] T002 Initialize TypeScript types from contracts in frontend/src/types/upload.ts
- [x] T003 [P] Verify Shadcn UI components installation (Card, Button, Progress, Alert)

## Phase 3.2: Core Utilities (Foundation) ✅ COMPLETED
**CRITICAL: These utilities MUST be implemented before UI components**
- [x] T004 [P] File validation utilities in frontend/src/utils/fileValidation.ts
- [x] T005 [P] Preview generation utilities in frontend/src/utils/previewGeneration.ts
- [x] T006 [P] Upload simulation utilities in frontend/src/utils/uploadSimulation.ts
- [x] T007 [P] File formatting utilities in frontend/src/utils/fileFormatting.ts

## Phase 3.3: Custom Hooks (State Management) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] T008 useUpload hook with state management in frontend/src/hooks/useUpload.ts
- [x] T009 useDragAndDrop hook for drag state in frontend/src/hooks/useDragAndDrop.ts

## Phase 3.4: Core UI Components (ONLY after utilities and hooks) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] T010 [P] ProgressIndicator component in frontend/src/components/upload/ProgressIndicator.tsx
- [x] T011 [P] ErrorAlert component in frontend/src/components/upload/ErrorAlert.tsx
- [x] T012 [P] ImagePreview component in frontend/src/components/upload/ImagePreview.tsx
- [x] T013 UploadArea component (drag & drop zone) in frontend/src/components/upload/UploadArea.tsx
- [x] T014 FileList component (grid layout) in frontend/src/components/upload/FileList.tsx

## Phase 3.5: Integration & Composition ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] T015 Main UploadImageUI container component in frontend/src/components/upload/UploadImageUI.tsx
- [x] T016 Event handler integration for file upload flow
- [x] T017 Error handling and user feedback integration
- [x] T018 Responsive design and mobile optimization

## Phase 3.6: Polish & Manual Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] T019 [P] Component styling refinements with Shadcn theming
- [x] T020 [P] Performance optimization for large file previews
- [x] T021 Manual testing following quickstart.md scenarios
- [x] T022 Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [x] T023 Mobile responsiveness testing

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T003) before utilities (T004-T007)
- Utilities (T004-T007) before hooks (T008-T009)
- Hooks (T008-T009) before components (T010-T014)
- Components (T010-T014) before integration (T015-T018)
- Integration before polish (T019-T023)

Task: "Preview generation utilities in frontend/src/utils/previewGeneration.ts"
Task: "Upload simulation utilities in frontend/src/utils/uploadSimulation.ts"
Task: "File formatting utilities in frontend/src/utils/fileFormatting.ts"
```

### Phase 3.4 - UI Components (Parallel)

```

## Detailed Task Descriptions

### T001: Create Frontend Project Structure
Create directory structure:
```
frontend/src/
├── components/upload/
├── hooks/
├── utils/
└── types/
```

### T002: Initialize TypeScript Types
Copy and adapt interfaces from contracts/upload-components.ts to frontend/src/types/upload.ts

### T004: File Validation Utilities
Implement functions:
- `isValidFileType(file: File, acceptedTypes: AcceptedFileTypes): boolean`
- `validateFile(file: File, acceptedTypes: AcceptedFileTypes): ValidationResult`
- `generateFileId(file: File): string`

### T005: Preview Generation Utilities

- `generatePreview(file: File): Promise<string>`
- `cleanupPreview(url: string): void`

### T006: Upload Simulation Utilities
Implement simulated upload progress for demo purposes:
- `simulateUpload(file, onProgress, onComplete, onError): cleanup function`

### T008: useUpload Hook
Custom hook managing upload state with all operations from UseUploadReturn interface

### T010-T014: UI Components
Each component following Shadcn UI patterns with proper TypeScript interfaces from contracts

### T015: Main Container Component
Orchestrates all upload functionality with complete user flow integration

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Manual testing only (no automated tests per user preference)
- All components use Shadcn UI exclusively
- Follow constitutional requirements strictly
- Commit after each completed task

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before task execution begins*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding implementation tasks
- [x] All entities from data model have utility tasks
- [x] No test tasks (skipped per user preference)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] All Shadcn UI requirements addressed
- [x] Manual testing plan provided via quickstart.md
