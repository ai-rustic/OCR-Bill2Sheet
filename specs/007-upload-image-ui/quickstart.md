# Quickstart: Upload Image UI

## Overview
This quickstart guide will help you test the Upload Image UI feature once implemented. The feature provides a drag-and-drop interface for uploading images with preview, progress tracking, and file validation.

## Prerequisites
- Frontend application running (Next.js development server)
- Modern web browser with HTML5 File API support
- Test image files (jpg, png, jfif formats)

## Testing Steps

### 1. Access Upload Page
Navigate to the upload page in your browser where the upload component is implemented.

### 2. Basic File Upload (Click to Select)
1. **Action**: Click the "Select Files" or "Choose Images" button
2. **Expected**: File dialog opens
3. **Action**: Select one or more image files (jpg, png, jfif)
4. **Expected**:
   - Files appear in upload list
   - Progress bars show upload simulation (0-100%)
   - Preview thumbnails generate when upload completes
   - Upload status changes from "uploading" to "completed"

### 3. Drag and Drop Upload
1. **Action**: Drag image files from file explorer to the upload area
2. **Expected**:
   - Drop zone highlights when files hover over it
   - Visual feedback shows files can be dropped
3. **Action**: Release files over the upload area
4. **Expected**:
   - Files are accepted and begin upload simulation
   - Same progress and preview behavior as click upload

### 4. File Type Validation
1. **Action**: Try to upload non-image files (txt, pdf, etc.)
2. **Expected**:
   - Error message appears: "Only jpg, png, and jfif files are allowed"
   - Files are rejected and not added to upload list
3. **Action**: Try unsupported image formats (gif, svg, etc.)
4. **Expected**: Same error behavior as non-image files

### 5. Multiple File Upload
1. **Action**: Upload 5-10 images simultaneously
2. **Expected**:
   - All files show individual progress bars
   - Uploads can proceed in parallel
   - Grid layout organizes previews neatly
   - No limit on number of files

### 6. File Management
1. **Action**: Click delete button (X) on uploaded image
2. **Expected**:
   - Image is removed from the list immediately
   - Preview thumbnail is cleaned up
   - Grid layout adjusts automatically
3. **Action**: Upload same file multiple times
4. **Expected**: System handles duplicates appropriately

### 7. Visual States Testing
1. **Drag States**: Verify hover effects when dragging files over upload area
2. **Progress States**: Check that progress bars animate smoothly
3. **Error States**: Confirm error messages are clearly visible
4. **Empty State**: Verify empty state message when no files are uploaded

### 8. Responsive Design Testing
1. **Desktop**: Test on large screen - grid should use multiple columns
2. **Tablet**: Test on medium screen - grid should adapt
3. **Mobile**: Test on small screen - grid should be single column

## Expected User Experience

### Successful Upload Flow
1. User sees clear upload area with instructions
2. Drag/drop or click to select works intuitively
3. Immediate feedback on file selection
4. Progress indicators show upload status
5. Preview thumbnails appear when ready
6. Easy deletion of unwanted files

### Error Handling
1. Clear error messages for invalid files
2. Non-disruptive error display (doesn't block other uploads)
3. Ability to dismiss error messages
4. Validation happens immediately on file selection

### Performance Expectations
1. Smooth animations and transitions
2. Responsive UI during file processing
3. Quick preview generation for reasonable file sizes
4. No UI blocking during upload simulation

- Verify drop event handlers are properly attached

### Grid Layout Issues
- Check CSS Grid or Flexbox support in browser
- Verify responsive breakpoints are working
- Test with different numbers of images
