   → ✅ Structure Decision: Option 2 (Web application)
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
   → ✅ Constitution requirements identified
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✅ No violations - frontend-only UI feature
   → ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✅ Research completed - no unknowns to resolve
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
   → ✅ Design artifacts generated
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → ✅ No violations after design
   → ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
   → ✅ Task generation strategy defined
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
   → ✅ Plan complete
```

## Summary
Primary requirement: Create a frontend image upload UI with drag-and-drop support, file previews, progress tracking, and file validation (jpg, png, jfif only). Technical approach: Shadcn UI components with React state management for file handling, no backend integration required.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript with React/Next.js 14+
**Primary Dependencies**: Shadcn UI, lucide-react icons, React hooks for state management
**Storage**: Local client-side file state (no persistence required)
**Testing**: N/A (TDD prohibited by constitution)
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (desktop and mobile)
**Project Type**: web - frontend focus
**Performance Goals**: Smooth UI interactions, responsive file previews
**Constraints**: Shadcn UI components only, no custom CSS beyond Tailwind
**Scale/Scope**: Single upload page component with unlimited file support

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **UI-Driven Development (Shadcn-First)**: Feature uses only Shadcn UI components
✅ **Component Validation with mcp**: Will verify components before implementation
✅ **TDD Explicitly Prohibited**: No testing requirements for this UI-only feature
✅ **Technology Stack Enforcement**: Uses Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, lucide-react
✅ **Mobile-first responsive design**: Shadcn components are responsive by default

**Result**: PASS - No constitutional violations detected

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - frontend-focused feature

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
✅ **Research Analysis**: No unknowns in Technical Context - all requirements are clear and use established patterns.

**Key Findings**:
- **File Handling**: HTML5 File API with React hooks for state management
- **Drag & Drop**: HTML5 Drag and Drop API with React event handlers
- **File Validation**: JavaScript file type checking against allowed extensions
- **Progress Simulation**: Client-side progress states (no actual upload to backend)
- **Previews**: FileReader API for generating image preview URLs

**Output**: All technical approaches confirmed, no clarifications needed.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model Analysis
**Core Entity**: UploadedImage
- Properties: file (File object), id (string), progress (0-100), status (uploading|completed|error), previewUrl (string), error (string|null)
- State transitions: uploading → completed/error
- Validation: file type must be jpg/png/jfif, file size reasonable for preview generation

### Component Architecture
**Primary Components** (all Shadcn UI):
- UploadArea: Drop zone with visual feedback
- FileList: Grid display of uploaded images
- ImagePreview: Individual image card with progress/delete
- ProgressBar: Upload progress indicator
- ErrorAlert: File validation error display

### API Contracts
Since this is UI-only with no backend integration, contracts represent the component interface:

**UploadArea Component**:
```typescript
interface UploadAreaProps {
  onFilesAdded: (files: File[]) => void;
  isAcceptingFiles: boolean;
  acceptedTypes: string[];
}
```

**ImagePreview Component**:
```typescript
interface ImagePreviewProps {
  image: UploadedImage;
  onDelete: (id: string) => void;
}
```

### Agent Context Update
Updated CLAUDE.md with new frontend upload component requirements and Shadcn UI component usage patterns.

**Output**: ✅ data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md generated

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate component creation tasks from data model
- Each Shadcn component → component creation task [P]
- Each user interaction → event handler implementation task
- Integration tasks for complete upload flow

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Bottom-up: Base components before composed components
- UI-first: Visual components before business logic
- Independent components marked [P] for parallel execution

**Estimated Output**: 8-12 numbered, ordered tasks focusing on component implementation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (manual UI testing, execute quickstart.md)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations detected - table not needed*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
