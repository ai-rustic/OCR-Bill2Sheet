# Feature Specification: PostgreSQL Database Connection for Axum Backend

**Feature Branch**: `001-connect-postgresql-database`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Connect PostgreSQL database with axum backend. The database name is: bill_ocr. All database connection information must be stored in a .env file. Use SQLx to handle the connection between the Axum backend and PostgreSQL. No table need to add in this phase"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature description provided: Connect PostgreSQL to Axum backend
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Backend system, Database
   ’ Actions: Connect, Configure
   ’ Data: Database connection parameters
   ’ Constraints: Use .env file, SQLx library, no tables in this phase
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: PostgreSQL server host/port not specified]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Database user credentials not specified]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Connection pool size preferences not specified]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Backend needs to establish and verify database connectivity
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focused on connection establishment and configuration
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Database connection configuration
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding connection parameters"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a backend system administrator, I need the Axum web server to successfully connect to a PostgreSQL database named "bill_ocr" so that the application can store and retrieve data for OCR bill processing functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the backend system is starting up, **When** the application initializes, **Then** it successfully establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database
2. **Given** database connection parameters are provided via environment variables, **When** the system reads the configuration, **Then** it uses those parameters to connect to the database
3. **Given** the database connection is established, **When** the system performs a health check, **Then** it confirms the connection is active and responsive

### Edge Cases
- What happens when database connection parameters are missing or invalid?
- How does the system handle database server unavailability during startup?
- What occurs when the specified database "bill_ocr" doesn't exist on the PostgreSQL server?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST establish a connection to a PostgreSQL database named "bill_ocr"
- **FR-002**: System MUST read database connection configuration from environment variables stored in a .env file
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate database connectivity during application startup
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle connection failures gracefully with appropriate error messages
- **FR-005**: System MUST support secure database authentication using username and password
- **FR-006**: System MUST connect to PostgreSQL server at [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: host and port not specified - localhost:5432 assumed?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST authenticate with database using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: username and password not specified]
- **FR-008**: System MUST configure connection pool with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: pool size and timeout settings not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Database Connection Configuration**: Contains host, port, database name, username, password, and connection pool settings required to establish PostgreSQL connectivity
- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage mechanism for database credentials and connection parameters loaded from .env file
