## Known Browser Issues and Workarounds

### Safari Issues
**Issue**: Image orientation problems on iOS
**Workaround**: Implement EXIF orientation reading and correction

**Issue**: Aggressive memory management
**Workaround**: Implement efficient preview cleanup and lazy loading

### Firefox Issues
**Issue**: Different drag and drop event handling
**Workaround**: Normalize event handling across browsers

**Issue**: MIME type detection differences
**Workaround**: Use file extension fallback validation

### Chrome Issues
**Issue**: Memory usage with large numbers of files
**Workaround**: Implement virtualization and progressive loading

### Edge Legacy Issues
**Issue**: Limited modern JavaScript support
**Workaround**: Provide polyfills and fallbacks for core functionality

## Polyfills and Fallbacks

### Required Polyfills
```javascript
// For older browsers
- ResizeObserver polyfill
- IntersectionObserver polyfill
- File API polyfills (if supporting very old browsers)
- Promise polyfill (for IE11 if needed)
```

### Feature Detection
```javascript
// Detect drag and drop support
const supportsDragAndDrop = 'draggable' in document.createElement('div');

// Detect File API support
const supportsFileAPI = window.File && window.FileReader && window.FileList;

// Detect modern JavaScript features
const supportsModernJS = typeof Promise !== 'undefined';
```
